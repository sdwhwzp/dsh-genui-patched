/**
 * Partial GenUI spec parsing: extract the components that are already
 * complete from a still-growing ```dsh-ui fence body, so the UI can render
 * top-down as the model writes — each finished component appears the moment
 * its JSON object closes, instead of the whole block waiting for the fence.
 *
 * Strategy (tolerant, white-list-agnostic, BOUNDED):
 * 1. Full parse first (the common settled case) — at most one.
 * 2. ONE left-to-right scan collects the repair candidates: every position
 *    where the prefix is bracket-balanced (trailing comma / fence tail) and
 *    every top-level `items[]` component close (an unfinished trailing
 *    component is dropped by closing the root array/object). Partial candidates
 *    must parse as a spec root; bare components wait for their own root close.
 *    The ring buffer keeps only the longest-direction candidates (≤ MAX_PARTIAL_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS),
 *    so the work is O(n) with a hard parse-attempt cap — a pathological
 *    input can never re-scan prefixes or burn seconds in JSON.parse.
 * 3. Candidates are tried longest first; the first that parses as a GenUI
 *    spec wins. Nothing parses → null (streaming partial, wait for more).
 *
 * The result is only ever a PREFIX of the intended spec, so it is always
 * safe to render: components already present are complete and valid.
 *
 * `ponytail:` the 32-candidate / 33-parse budget is the protection ceiling;
 * only real streaming samples proving a recovery shortfall justify switching
 * to a tokenizing parser.
